This repository contains the do-file codes needed to replicate my research progress about female labor force participation in Mexico. 

To replicate my results just follow these steps:

Save all the do-files in the same folder on your computer. 

Save the databases in the same folder that you saved the do files on your computer. 

Change the directory "$root" in the master do file. 

Run the master dofile.
