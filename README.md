This repository contains the do-file codes needed to replicate my research progress about female labor force participation in Mexico. 

To replicate my results just follow these steps:

Save all the do-files included in this repository using the exact name for each file, and save them all together in the same folder on your computer. 

Save the databases in the same folder where you saved the do files on your computer. 

Change the directory "$root" in the master do file. 

Run the master dofile.
