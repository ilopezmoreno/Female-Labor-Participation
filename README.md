This repository contains the do-files needed to replicate my research progress about female labor force participation in Mexico. To replicate my research progress just follow the steps below:

Save all the do-files in the same folder on your computer. 
Save the databases in the same folder that you saved the do files on your computer. 
Change the directory "$root" in the master do file. 
Run the master dofile.
